# Count and Say

## Description
The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

    countAndSay(1) = "1"
    countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.

To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

## Example 

```
Example 1:

Input: n = 1
Output: "1"
Explanation: This is the base case.
```

```
Input: n = 4
Output: "1211"
Explanation:
countAndSay(1) = "1"
countAndSay(2) = say "1" = one 1 = "11"
countAndSay(3) = say "11" = two 1's = "21"
countAndSay(4) = say "21" = one 2 + one 1 = "12" + "11" = "1211"
```



## Solution
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {string}
 */
var countAndSay = function(n) {
    if(n===1) return "1";

    let pre = countAndSay(n-1);
    let result = "",
        left = 0,
        right = 0;
    
    while(right < pre.length){
        while(pre[left] === pre[right] && right < pre.length) {
            right++;
        }
        result = result + (right-left).toString() + pre[left];
        left = right;
    }
    return result;

}; 
```
